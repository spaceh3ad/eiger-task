# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/Proxy.sol [Line: 64](src/Proxy.sol#L64)

	```solidity
	        bool ok = IERC20(_weth).approve(
	```



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol [Line: 2](lib/forge-std/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.6.2;
	```

- Found in src/Multisig.sol [Line: 2](src/Multisig.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```



## L-3: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol [Line: 2](lib/forge-std/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.6.2;
	```

- Found in src/Multisig.sol [Line: 2](src/Multisig.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in src/Swapper.sol [Line: 47](src/Swapper.sol#L47)

	```solidity
	    function swapEtherToToken(
	```



## NC-2: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in src/Multisig.sol [Line: 115](src/Multisig.sol#L115)

	```solidity
	            _threshold < 3 ||
	```

- Found in src/Multisig.sol [Line: 149](src/Multisig.sol#L149)

	```solidity
	        approvalCount = 1; // Count proposer as 1st voter
	```

- Found in src/Proxy.sol [Line: 65](src/Proxy.sol#L65)

	```solidity
	            0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564,
	```

- Found in src/Swapper.sol [Line: 56](src/Swapper.sol#L56)

	```solidity
	                    fee: 3000, // 0.3% fee
	```

- Found in src/Swapper.sol [Line: 58](src/Swapper.sol#L58)

	```solidity
	                    deadline: block.timestamp + 1, // 1 second from now
	```



## NC-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol [Line: 8](lib/forge-std/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
	```

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol [Line: 12](lib/forge-std/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol#L12)

	```solidity
	    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
	```

- Found in src/Multisig.sol [Line: 72](src/Multisig.sol#L72)

	```solidity
	    event Upgrade(address newContract);
	```

- Found in src/Multisig.sol [Line: 77](src/Multisig.sol#L77)

	```solidity
	    event UpgradeProposed(address proposedContract, uint256 proposalVersion);
	```
